<h1>The Best Movies According to Nol</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Red, White and Royal Blue (2023)</h3>
<p>
  It's all about fighting for your love despite the challenges and judgment that
  may come from the outside. And it's LGBTQIA+
</p>

<h3>Mulan (1998)</h3>
<p>Asian. Family Problems. Self-doubt. Redemption. That's all.</p>

<h3>Titanic (1997)</h3>
<p>
  Truly iconic, first movie I watched in VHS. Even made a painting out of it.
